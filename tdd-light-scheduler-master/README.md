tdd-light-scheduler
===============

## Instructions
For this activity you will implement a very basic light scheduler using TDD and CppUMock. A basic light scheduler has been sketched out in `LightScheduler.h`. The scheduler should be able to schedule multiple actions (turn on, turn off) and execute them. The schedules should be executed if the current time matches the scheduled time when the `LightScheduler_Run` method is called. Mocks for the lights and for the time source have been provided.

In order to build and run your tests, you can either execute `make` from a terminal or press ctrl+B in Eclipse to build and run the tests.
